Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data

This repository contains the needed code and background to run data cleaning analysis on the Human Activity recognition dataset.

Files:

run_analysis.R
This file is an R script that contains all the code required to tidy and format the dataset.
In brief it performs the following functions:
	1) Combines all files into a single dataset
	2) Extracts mean and standard deviation variables into a smaller dataset
	3) Adds descriptive names to each activity observation
	4) Re-labels the columns of the dataset with more descriptive names
	5) Creates a final data subset that features the mean for each variable for each subject and activity performed

CodeBook.md
This file is a codebook that describes the code and steps taken to clean the data in detail.
